    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that can help people in their daily lives. Technology allows me to turn ideas into reality, and coding gives me the power to create useful, efficient, and innovative solutions. Continuous learning, creativity, and the ability to make an impact motivate me to grow in this field.
